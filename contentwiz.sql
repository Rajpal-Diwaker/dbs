Mistakes can lead to complications or missed warning signs and may increase a patient’s chance of winding up back in the hospital. So Morrissey is working with Microsoft to train computers to make the kind of snap judgments about new patients’ risk factors that hurried humans often flub. “We don’t want to take the intuition and clinical decision-making out of the process,” he says. “We want to facilitate it.”','As hospitals digitize patient records and amass huge amounts of data, many are turning to companies such as Microsoft, SAS, Dell, IBM, and Oracle for their data-mining expertise, which can help medical providers perform detective work and improve care. The so-called Big Data business has already permeated other industries and generated more than $30 billion in revenues last year, according to research firm IDC.

It empowers us as consumers to get exactly what we want from a brand, when we want it. The benefits within healthcare are equally compelling and have the potential to radically improve the care we receive from the NHS. Data is fast becoming our lifeblood.\r\n','Most of us are in agreement that stretching NHS staff further isn’t the answer and could in fact be detrimental to patient wellbeing. But underfunding has reached crucial levels, so it is vital that efficiencies with technology make key differences in the long term. Many trusts and practices are embracing next generation communication and collaboration technologies such as video calling for remote care or smart IoT devices instead of elderly assisted living. While these technologies are making an obvious difference to patient care, the data they generate combined with historic hospital information will be the ultimate game changer in improving healthcare efficiency and patient care.\r\n\r\nAnalysing this untapped resource can help identify and address hospital bottlenecks at crucial stages. Data analytics will enable hospitals to visualise and compare data from various touch points across departments, eliminating silos and allowing for better triage of incoming patients and assignment of available beds. By understanding bed occupancy from a mobile dashboard in real time, surgeons can be more efficient at scheduling theatre operations and reduce waiting times.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull patient records accessible anywhere during emergencies\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, a single platform containing patient records gathered from various sources, including wearable and other IoT devices, will enable clinicians to quickly access a patient’s full medical history. This could include DNA code, fingerprints, facial and eye recognition, donor information, current prescriptions, family medical history, current ailments, and allergies. Imagine triage where doctors could immediately understand which patient requires most urgent treatment. In an ageing population with ever increasing bed usage, this would greatly increase efficiency. An unconscious patient carrying data history on a wearable device could be triaged appropriately and given the right treatment based on their DNA and medical history. Their family could be quickly informed via instant message and given access rights to the patient’s ward.\r\n\r\nPopulation health management\r\n\r\n\r\nBy layering patient records with demographic and employment data, the sector can apply predictive analytics technology to foresee and mitigate population health crises such as diabetes. This improved level of patient understanding will enable hospitals to better target health education initiatives so patients can make lifestyle changes. Hospitals can also evaluate the performance of vaccination programmes to reduce health risks before they develop into conditions that require treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter data protection and staff resource allocation\r\n\r\n\r\nMultifactor security systems using biometrics and data analytics instead of passwords and swipe cards will enable staff to easily and securely gain access to patient files, wards and theatres and reduce the risk of data theft.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn analytics based ID system will also allow doctors to locate staff around the hospital in real time, helping them to better respond to a major incident such as a terror attack. Doctors can use smart devices to reallocate the most appropriate staff immediately to patients based on their injuries and medical history. Clinicians will also be able to visualise data to identify patterns in wards where certain areas might be tended to less often, and recognise any links between attention levels and patient recovery and mortality. Changes to the ward layout and staffing schedules could make a significant difference to a patient’s wellbeing.\r\n','The UK is one the world’s most forward thinking digital economies and the healthcare system must not be excluded.

It brings the power of IBM data management, information governance and integration and data science offerings to your private cloud. And, because it is based on the open source Kubernetes technology stack, it can significantly reduce the inefficiencies of maintaining and managing multiple data science analytics tools in different environments. There’s no need to use different tools to manage data access, preparation, exploration, statistics, machine learning and other data services.\r\n\r\n2. Enjoy freedom with multi-cloud portability and elasticity\r\n\r\nWe have all encountered scenarios where one or another cloud environment might not be suitable for certain data workloads—for example, because of security. Many companies stretch applications across private, public or hybrid clouds. They do so for many reasons, including backup, resilience or regulatory constraints. By building data apps on microservices-based containerized architecture, you can make sure that apps are portable between different cloud environments.\r\n\r\n3. Integrate security and governance into your data insights\r\n\r\nAn integrated containerized platform approach makes sure there is little room for security breaches and data risks. This is a fundamentally better approach than wiring the data portfolio together from discrete products. I strongly believe that security isn’t a problem you ever fully solve. Bad actors and sophisticated adversaries constantly evolve. With an integrated data platform, businesses can keep improving techniques to stay ahead and detect unknown patterns of threats faster.\r\n\r\nIn addition, IBM Cloud Private for Data provides the following robust data governance characteristics:\r\n\r\nUnderstand, cleanse and prepare your data to create data preparation pipelines visually\r\n\r\nGrant user access levels and enforce business policies\r\n\r\nIndex for search, visualize consumers and producers of assets with lineage, metrics and quality profiles\r\n\r\nFind data and analytics assets in the Enterprise Catalogue\r\n\r\nThere are many more ways to realize value by using containers or Kubernetes stack for your data analytics workloads.

The clearest and most immediate business impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been a major disruption to supply chains. Having originated in China, the region was hit hard as a large number of citizens contracted the disease and many were forced into quarantine. This led to partial and full shutdowns of plants and factories, some of which were being used by prominent technology companies to manufacture their goods and products. For example, Apple experienced shortages on its iPhone supply as a result of the company\'s primary manufacturer, Foxconn, shutting down much of its production in China. Ultimately for Apple, this will lead to a significantly reduced forecast in iPhone shipments through Q1—by as much as 10%, according to estimates by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cited by MacRumors. And while companies often have contingency plans, which revolve around ramping up production in a region that isn\'t impacted, the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the globe makes it very difficult to pinpoint which regions would be least affected. Even then, the momentum and resources of the Chinese economy will not be easily replicated—\'Made in China\' initiatives have seen the government invest billions in advanced manufacturing sectors, including telecommunications equipment and semiconductors.\n2. The spread of the coronavirus has caused several of the most important tech conferences to be canceled, likely resulting in numerous missed partnership opportunities. Most notably, Mobile World Congress (MWC), which was set to take place February 24-27 in Barcelona, was canceled due to concerns over the virus. MWC is a cornerstone event in the connectivity industry, as it brings together the most important companies in the space to network, share innovations and forge new business partnerships. Several companies rescheduled the events they had planned for MWC, but the continued presence of the coronavirus led others to cancel them entirely. Beyond MWC, Facebook canceled its F8 developer conference and Global Marketing Summit; Google shifted its Google Cloud Next event to online only; and IBM likewise had to livestream its developer\'s conference, which last year hosted over 30,000 attendees. Altogether, the cancellation of major tech events has incurred over $1 billion in direct economic losses, according to estimates from PredictHQ cited by Recode.\nOnline alternatives have helped limit the fallout from canceled conferences, but tech industries will likely still suffer a period of stifled innovation due to forgone in-person business opportunities. Conference attendees do not have the same opportunities to network via live streaming as they do attending in-person events. It would be harder for marketers to casually share best practices over the live streamed Facebook Global Marketing Summit, for instance, than it would be if the event actually took place. Though it is difficult to quantify the value of these chance encounters or informal network sessions, the effects will undoubtedly be felt throughout the impacted industries.\n3. The growing need for remote interactions amid the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted a need for 5G technology, potentially accelerating adoption in the long term. 5G\'s lightning-fast speeds, near-instantaneous communications and increased connection density make it primed for remote interactions, which has become top of mind for many organizations and enterprises as caution mounts over the spread of the virus. Two key areas—telehealth and teleconferencing—are becoming critical for enterprise operations amid the pandemic, and we think that increased dependence on these areas will help strengthen the appeal of 5G:\n','Online alternatives have helped limit the fallout from canceled conferences but tech industries will likely still suffer a period of stifled innovation due to forgone in person business opportunities The spread of the coronavirus has caused several of the most important tech conferences to be canceled likely resulting in numerous missed partnership opportunities The growing need for remote interactions amid the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted a need for G technology potentially accelerating adoption in the long term MWC is a cornerstone event in the connectivity industry as it brings together the most important companies in the space to network share innovations and forge new business partnerships Several companies rescheduled the events they had planned for MWC but the continued presence of the coronavirus led others to cancel them entirely Altogether the cancellation of major tech events has incurred over billion in direct economic losses according to estimates from PredictHQ cited by Recode The clearest and most immediate business impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been a major disruption to supply chains ',NULL,'2020-03-30 15:19:11',NULL),(28,5,1,'Reducing Churn in Telecom through Advanced Analytics','Analytics, Telecom','Telecom','McKinsey','https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/reducing-churn-in-telecom-through-advanced-analytics','The telecom industry continues to face growing pricing pressure worldwide.

Using data from Mercado Libre, and its lending product Mercado Crédito, we compare the defaults of firms based on their credit score with machine learning and big data from the e-commerce platform (‘internal rating’) and a traditional credit bureau score (Figure 3, left panel). To date, the internal rating has been superior to the credit bureau in predicting defaults (Figure 3, right panel). However, the jury is still out. Any judgement on the ability of Big Tech credit scoring to better pinpoint creditworthiness should be based on a complete cycle, evaluating the probability of default in stress situations.\r\n\r\nBig data refers to the analysis of very large data sets to reveal patterns, trends and associations. The data can come from a range of sources, including satellite imagery, drone videos, simulations, crowdsourcing, social media and global positioning systems.\r\n','The rapid growth of Big Tech in finance will bring both benefits and risks to the future banking system. Big Tech firms may enhance competition and financial inclusion and contribute to the efficiency of financial services. Conversely, such firms may further concentrate market power or give rise to new systemic risks (BIS 2019). Overall, it is important to understand how Big Tech firms fit within the current framework of financial regulation, and under which principles regulation should be organised. All these are relevant aspects for future research in this area.\r\n','','2020-01-10 04:07:08',5),(32,5,1,'How data analytics is transforming tax administration\r\n','Tax trust bigdata analytics \r\n','BFSI','EY','https://go.ey.com/2WgIVD0\r\n','Tax and finance departments can deliver value by using data analytics to manage risk, control costs and drive business decisions.\r\n','How tax authorities are using data analytics\r\n\r\nMany tax authorities pull together data from a variety of sources to develop a more complete picture of companies’ tax profiles.

While 2018 was a year of growth for many retailers and brands accelerated by tax cuts and low unemployment, we’re entering a more precarious year. The stock market is in flux, many retailers are facing the reality of steepening tariffs, emerging markets are flexing their muscles as they take on a greater share of global growth, and it’s anyone’s guess on which way the wind might blow fickle consumers and their expectations for connectivity around every transaction. That said, one could also say that the glass is more than half full, and that these challenges also present opportunities for savvy retailers and brands willing to face the winds head','Here are 10 key points of view on what the retail industry should expect in 2019 : 1) Retailers Will Get Personal with Zero-Party Data : Zero-party data is information intentionally shared by the consumer, which is empowering marketers to build direct relationships with consumers, and, in turn, better personalize their marketing efforts, services, offers and product recommendations without the guesswork. 2) Small is the New Big : These niche brands are the future of the retail industry, and the smart traditional retailers are finding ways to participate in this growth.  Walmart’s acquisition of Bonobos is one example of what I believe will be a wave of interesting partnerships and consolidations in this space. 3) Customer-Centricity Will Go Mainstream : In 2018, retailers learned that simply monitoring social media is not enough. We believe that, thanks to the adoption of technologies like Voice of Consumer (VoC) Analytics, 2019 will be the year that the industry actually makes the customer-centric model happen, as it offers a robust solution that enables them to determine what their customers want and also to deliver it – with speed and at scale. 4) Retailers and Consumers Will Begin to Feel the Weight of Tariffs : Retailers will be faced with making decisions in 2019 to determine the categories and products where they raise prices and push the cost increases onto the customers, and where they need to absorb the cost increases themselves. This may force retailers to evaluate whether it makes sense to exit certain categories if they cannot sell product profitably. 5) Algorithms Take Control : In its 2018 study entitled How Analytics and Digital will drive Next Generation Retail Merchandising, McKinsey stated, “Winning decisions are increasingly driven by analytics more than instinct, experience, or merchant ‘art’. By leveraging smarter tools—those beyond backward-looking, “hind sighting” analysis—retailers can increasingly make forward-looking predictions that are quickly becoming the “table stakes” necessary to keep up.” 6) Millennials will flock to Brands – they will be Luxury : Millennials seek and find brands they want, regardless of channel.  Of course, they prefer to shop online, but they also value experiences and will enter a store if it delivers something unique. Claudia D\'Arpizio, a Milan-based partner at Bain &  Co. and one of the study\'s lead authors, stated: “The brands that are well positioned to capture the Millennial market are moving away from the old luxury habits: from celebrating their own heritage to celebrating consumers’ passions; from looking obsessively into their past to providing futuristic aesthetic visions; from \'shouting their name\' to enabling consumers’ self-expression.” Gucci is a great example and is resonating with Millennials\r\n\r\nI am personally fascinated by predictive analytics and the ability to combine data elements to create an approximate idea of what the future may hold. Although data modeling has been used quite extensively in certain industries (e.g., weather predictions based on specific historic models and key indicators, insurance estimates and actuarial tables, etc.), the concept of applying similar science to retail holds unrealized potential. Given technology advancements and data-mining tools, potential future predictions -- in other words, answering the question “What lies ahead?” -- seems far more attainable than ever before. Considering big data already captured within the retail sector, it becomes mind-boggling. Virtually all industries have pools of information that could be used for predictive purposes. This reminds me of a presentation I sat through nearly three decades ago by a then-IBM executive who suggested that the future will be owned by those who have the keys to data and the intelligence that it generates. And, as recently as this month\'s National Retail Federation event, the power of data was repeatedly emphasized.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent blog post from McKinsey, \"winning decisions are increasingly driven by analytics more than instinct, experience, or merchant \'art\'; what succeeded in the past is now a poor predictor of the future, and analytics is helping to inform and unlock new pockets of growth.\"\r\n\r\n','We may see “perception” become “reality” with our economy.  The media continues to hype the market’s volatility and a potential recession while corporate earnings and unemployment figures continue to speak differently.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve is raising rates to allow them to “have something to work with” if a recession were to occur. Retail growth is over 4% and the economy is healthy; however, this sustained “perception” has the potential to create the “reality” of a recession later in 2019.  I don’t want to be among the many that helps to create this inaccurate “perception”, so I am focused on the facts (stated above). As in any year, 2019 will have tremendous opportunity for those who spot the trends and position their companies to capitalize on them.\r\n','1) A recent survey found that 64 percent of consumers are actually fine with retailers saving purchase history and personal preferences if more personalization is offered.  2) A study by Retail Dive found that digitally-native brands plan to open over 850 stores in the next 5 years.  In comparison, traditional brick-and-mortar-based retailers closed approximately 7,000 stores and opened approximately 3,000 stores in 2018, nearly all of which were in the value category (Dollar General, Five Below, Aldi, etc). 3) Recently, Kalypso’s 2018 Digital Innovation Research found that 84 percent of retailers say VoC analytics are important and 59 percent are investing now or will be by the end of 2019. 5) In 2019, we’ll start to see the real impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports - which will increase from 10 percent to a hefty 25 percent. 6) Millennial purchasing power continues to increase.  By 2025, Bain & Co. forecasts that Millennials and Generation Z will represent 45% of the global personal luxury goods market. \r\n\r\nAt 55 percent, just over half of the U.S. is subscribed to Prime, which is about the same as in 2017.  This was the first year that Prime membership did not increase. Some of this may be due to the fact that Amazon raised the Prime membership price in May to $119, but it is more likely a function of reaching a saturation point in the U.S. market.','2020-08-05 10:31:59',5),(34,5,1,'Retail Analytics: Driving Success in Retail Industry with Business Analytics','Retail Industry, Big Data, Business Analytics, Retail Analytics, Marketing Strategy','Retail','reserachgate','https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323309092_Retail_Analytics_Driving_Success_in_Retail_Industry_with_Business_Analytics','As retail market becomes extensively competitive, the ability to optimize on serving business processes while satisfying customer expectations has never been more important. Therefore, managing and channelizing data to work towards customer delight as well as generate healthy profits is crucial to survive prosperously. In the case of big retail players internationally as well as in India, data or rather big data analytics is now being applied at every stage of the retail process - tracking emerging popular products, forecasting sales and future demand through predictive simulation, optimising product placements and offers via customer heat-mapping and many more. Alongside this, identifying the customers likely to be interested in particular product types based on their previous purchase behaviours, working out the best way to approach them through targeted marketing efforts and finally working out what to sell them next is what forms the core of data analytics. This article is the outcome of a descriptive research on the past, present and future of retail industry and the application of business analytics in shaping appropriate marketing strategies.','CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR IN RETAIL INDUSTRY It is expected that consumer goods firms will now be focusing on online and social media channels to get into consumer’s mindshare due to the growing mobile internet revolution in India. About 650 million people are expected to be online by 2020, out of which 250 million will be shopping online - spending more than $50 billion. Interestingly, at least $5 billion of this expenditure is expected to be on packaged consumer goods. In the modern, technology-driven world, users or customers in the retail scenario, are not only accustomed to the digital comfort, but they are also very savvy in terms of using it. Thus, when it comes to retail, a customer who now has a fast paced world and is extremely used to instant gratification, is not only impatient and busy but also looking to be the beneficiary of an excellent service. Just like there are many customers out there, there also exist numerous companies, which are rapidly striving to get online and combat the massive competition, from the others like them. In their bid to stay on top of the game, it is important for those companies to be able to fully understand, exactly what makes the customer click, their likes, their dislikes, basically a full 360-degree view of their customer. This understanding gives them a solid ground to excel at satisfying their customers and on the other hand, attracting the right kind of prospective customers as well. Analytics plays the most crucial role in this process as, it is the very thing that drives those ‘understand what makes the customer decide’, policies of the retail companies. Through the various functions that it carries forward, it creates insights such as, how would a company be able to increase margins at the product level, it also provides insights in what the customer is like, or why the customer would want to buy a certain product. This is called Market Basket Analysis. The analytics help the companies also identify those items, which a customer would be very likely of purchasing together, what promotions and offers would work the very best for which products and personalized offers for every individual customer. These insights are totally customer based, but there are also those that are fully company based insights. Analytics is able to give the insights in terms of how much spending would a company have to do, store wise product mix, optimal pricing that would get them more buyers, efficient stock strategies and many more. These, small yet effective insights, gives a retailer acumen about future consumer behavior, which is a must to stay alive in the competitive retail world. This would be a far cry from the historical retailers who only scratched the surface while making use of the piles of customer data available with them. And with the social media redefining the rules of the game, understanding and leveraging these social media sentiments can give them insights into the customer behavior and intentions. The formidable power of social media that can make or break brands is forcing the retailers to transform the retail landscape dramatically with interactive and immediate communication strategies pushing away the traditional approach. Customer has indeed become the king for retailers that needs an ‘out of the way’ experience with unexpected customized and bespoke services on offer to be able to make an impression in the bevy of lures already preoccupying their minds. The examples of EBay, Amazon and so many others, who have successfully reaped great benefits of data analytics, goes on to prove that retailers, large and small would definitely be able to harness the miraculous benefits of analysing not only structured, but also unstructured data on consumer behavior.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGES IN RETAIL ANALYTICS Retailers have already started putting data analytics at the heart of their operations across the value chain - procurement, supply chain, sales and marketing, store operations, and customer management. However, they now need to establish a big data ecosystem, which processes multiple terabytes of new data and petabytes of historical data, which will help them improve their revenues via analytics-based decision-making. While this may sound really exciting, big data management and analysis comes with its own set of challenges. Several issues will have to be kept in mind to optimize the full capabilities of big data. Privacy, security, intellectual property, and even liability policies need to be stringent in terms of big data. Since big data encapsulates high end analytics, specially trained professionals need to be added to the team to utilize and functionalize the big data. Companies need to integrate information from multiple data sources, often from third parties, as well as deploy an efficient data to aid such an environment. Many times companies fall in shortsightedness, failing to implement insights from analytics. However, this could be fixed by continuous alterations of retail styles where a certain team is allotted for task of arrangement of insights and their implementation','Retailing is at the platform for more data-driven disruption because the quality of data available from internet purchases, social-network conversations, and recently, location-specific smart phone interactions have emerged into a new entity for digital based transactions. Improved performance, better risk management, and the ability to unearth insights that would otherwise remain hidden, are the benefits organisations reap through utilization of big data management. Retailers can benefit immensely form a structured analytics-driven approach that will help them understand how their customers are using their products and services, how their operations and supply chain are performing, how to manage their workforce and how to identify key risks - insights that they then can then act upon. The pace and the dexterity with which micro data is collected, gives the retailers immediate insights on the shopping trends. This analysis on the move allows them to adjust their prices and add to the lure by announcing on the spot discounts on the sales floor based on their current and previous shopping patterns. This data, often collected through interactive mobile devices in stores, provides the retailer an understanding of the buyers needs and give insights into making smarter decisions about product placement in the store. Data capture and analytics usage certainly have come a long way in the last ten years, and it is interesting to look back on how trends in data analytics have affected the marketplace. As the Internet of Things expands further and our world becomes even more connected, this space will continue to evolve.','1) Backed by robust economic growth and rising household incomes, consumer spending in India is expected to touch $3.6 trillion (about Rs.240 trillion) by 2020, increasing India’s share in global consumption to 5.8%—more than twice its current levels.

The store was arranged to cater to her needs, but the neighborhood was now comprised of older adults with limited mobility and fixed incomes. How could the data predict their navigation pattern, category preferences and better cater to their overall shopping occasion? The hypothesis I would look to prove is whether shelves should be lower and aisles wider, whether certain categories (e.g., sugary cereals and baby diapers) should be downsized and how to rearrange the checkout to be less confined and more staff-centric. Predictive analytics could be used to model the potential result of such changes and allow the retailer to assess whether such an investment would be justified by the return.','Today a delicate balance exists between staid and proven stock keeping units (SKUs) and potential innovators and disrupters.

We will also outline a number of use cases where inserting the right data and analysis can deliver value to the decisions retailers are making today. This helps them to optimize every part of the customer decision journey to improve conversion, margins, and brand experience.','Analytics are driving the move from merchant-driven business models—where the product is the differentiator—to digital models, where every decision is informed by data. Brand engagements are becoming more closely aligned with individual shopper preferences, creating a brand relationship that is shifting from a “nice to have,” time-sensitive offer-based relationship to a “must have” digital companionship based on deep insights and understanding of the consumer. To achieve this critical differentiation, retailers are depending less on increasingly shorter product cycles and more on the enduring differentiators of relationship and customer experience created through strategic use of data and analytics. Retailers need good data; but more importantly, they need the right data to gain the insights that can transform their businesses. Value comes from analyzing new data types in the context of specific business knowledge, such as transaction log (T-log) and loyalty information, campaign results, and pricing actions. Every shopper engagement, inventory movement, and promotion leaves a data trail providing opportunities for new capabilities, both from historical data and real-time information, to support decisions across the business. \r\n\r\nHow Can Retailers Get Started with Analytics? Defining a far-reaching analytics strategy starts with the basics: having a good vision of the endgame. Each retailer needs to answer the question, “What does it take to win?” in the context of their specific company, market, promotion, category, department, or process. It sounds easy, but it often is not: Part of designing a data strategy is defining the decisions that need to be made and mapping the right data to inform them. Once the data requirements are defined, the analytics sources can be selected. Let’s look at some simple examples to highlight the process. Imagine that what it takes to win for a mall retail store is the basic need to get the shopper to enter the store. Perhaps the conversion rate is actually quite high once they enter, with an average ticket that is up year over year, but the greatest hindrance to “winning” is the low volume of traffic entering the store. The focus for this retailer is to acquire and analyze data on traffic passing by versus actual shoppers entering their store. Managers would want to examine their “mall traffic conversion” (the percent of shoppers passing by who also enter the store) over time as they change window displays, execute incentives, and leverage promotions to shoppers who are nearby, on mobile, using social media, or visiting the store website. They should also be interested in mobile metrics such as unique and repeat visits and associated and unassociated devices, as the store will benefit from monitoring Twitter and photo postings to ensure the right\r\nproducts are being featured. Knowing what works best for getting shoppers to enter the store, measuring it, and achieving\r\nit allows this retailer to use the right data to win in their business\r\n\r\nUse Cases: Retail Analytics in the Real World The applied uses of analytics to real-world decision making are numerous, and many retail industry leaders are achieving value with innovative new approaches. A few recent examples include: • Specialty retailers using video analytics to study customer paths and behavior, helping them to design more effective store layouts • Big Box retailers investing in Wi-Fi networking and new mobile way-finding apps to help customers navigate through large stores or malls, getting them to desired products faster • Resorts and hotels investing in mobile analytics to gather shopper information from their retail spaces • Mall operators using the network to track social media and shopping patterns, and delivering this value-add information to tenants • Grocery and fast-moving goods retailers utilizing video analytics for traffic and conversion analysis, and then using the same information to integrate workforce management and re-align staffing based on traffic trends • Specialty retailers using social sentiment analytics to improve “voice of the customer” feedback to assess overall brand status and the launch of new products, services, or offers','In this paper, we have introduced a vision of analytics as a new guiding principle for operating in today’s tumultuous retail environment. We’ve discussed the power of becoming a datadriven decision-making culture, and shown how access to accurate, scalable, and actionable data can help retailers set a roadmap to success through a better understanding of their customers and of their store operations.

Merchandising analytics enable planners to align their merchandising decisions with customer expectations. The key areas of merchandising analytics are assortment planning, product adjacency and space allocation. Marketing analytics: To keep up with changing customer demands and ensure loyalty, retailers need marketing analytics for deeper customer insight, targeted interactions and improved customer services.  Marketing analytics quickly combine all relevant customer data—from point of sale systems,customer relationship management system, loyalty cards, etc., with social media data—perform sophisticated analytics, and share insights to help optimise marketing decisions. It can help to deepen customer insight,optimise multichannel performance, improve marketing effectiveness and enhance social media presence. Supply chain analytics: Retail profitability is directly impacted by the logistics efficiency to maximise demand fulfilment and avoid any back orders or stock-outs. These include interventions in logistics, inventory and supplier performance. Store operation analytics: The performance of retail operations depends on various factors,including the effectiveness of the store staff, the cost incurred on them, reduction of pilferage from the store, management of inventory at the right levels and improvement of the overall staff performance. The important component of a successful analytics framework is an efficient information excellence backbone which integrates the data from various data sources like customers, point of sales, suppliers, market, and social media, and stores it in a ready-to-use format for various analytical modelling applications. The choice of technology would depend on the existing technology landscape, the budget of the retailer and the functionalities that they would like to have in their analytics solutions. ','Adoption of analytics : Hybrid model (recommended): This approach is a combination of the in-house and outsourcing approaches. An external consultant works with the retailer to set up an analytics centre of excellence and to co-create various analytics models on its premises. This not only helps in gaining access to the latest best practices prevalent in the market but also keeps the retailer in control at all times. Data-led insight has the power to add business value to every part of the value chain and to every area of business decision-making. As we rapidly move towards a connected retail environment, ompanies need to master the full potential of the customer data that is collected at numerous digital touchpoints. Retailers have already started putting data analytics at the heart of their operations across the value hain—procurement, supply chain, sales and marketing, store operations, and customer management. They now need to establish a big data ecosystem which processes multiple terabytes of new data and petabytes of historical data.

What customers have the highest potential for revenue growth? Increasingly, data is seen as a valuable asset for banking leaders looking to successfully navigate this volatile environment. How do you make sense of all that data? For many in banking, business - analytics is the answer.                                                                                              ','a) Why banking analytics: The next level- Harnessing the power of data with analytics is not a new concept to the banking industry. In fact, the industry is widely considered to be a pioneer in the field of analytics. Analytics should be a part of every major initiative, in areas ranging from customers and risk to finance, workforce, and supply chain. Just as important, analytics is most powerful when it’s not run as a series of mutually-independent programs. Of course, along the way many banks have primarily developed deep, unconnected pockets of analytics expertise within their organizations. Today, the challenge is to develop analytic strengths that span the organization— not just pockets of expertise aligned behind single business lines. Furthermore, banks need to harness both external and internal data from structured and unstructured sources. That’s why analytics has taken on renewed importance recently. b) What to do now: Prioritize the areas of focus Identify where data and analytics can have the greatest impact and obtain leadership engagement from the start (e.g., Customer, Risk, Finance). Streamline your data Provide an integrated view of high quality data vs. siloed pockets across products and lines of business (e.g., Single View of the Customer, Aggregated Risk Exposure by Product). Integrate with decision management systems Analytics insights aren’t worth having if they don’t lead to smarter decisions. Fortunately, these insights can be plugged directly into decision management systems. Fight for talent Finding the right talent (statistical modeling, little data and ‘Big Data’, functional depth) is one of the biggest challenges. Develop a talent plan that builds on both existing internal talent and external sources. Make connections Your organization probably already has developed pockets of analytics excellence. A smart plan for connecting teams across the organization can bolster existing strengths and foster new ones. ','It’s okay to start small: Rebooting and refocusing your bank’s analytics capabilities can seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Many banks start with a small project and expand from there. 6) Analytics isn’t enough; adoption is essential. Use whatever means necessary—incentives, role modeling, communication, more communication—to get decision makers to use the new tools. Way too often, best-in-class algorithms sit idle in computers because users do not trust what they regard as a black box, fear the impact it could have on their roles, or simply do not want to go through the discomfort of change. Creating analytics is like putting jet fuel in your car. At the end of the day, if the driver does not develop the skills needed to drive faster, the effort is wasted. 7) Analytics is a team sport. The skills banks need to make analytics work cannot be contained within a single person—at least not yet. Your teams must include true experts on data science, engineering, data architecture, and design.

Shutters open to let in the stream of customers waiting outside the branch. Branch officers are neatly seated at their respective counters such as the ‘Demand Draft,’ or the ‘May I Help You’ desk. A peek inside the back office shows the branch manager conducting his daily sales huddle with his relationship managers, sales officers and field staff. The mood is highly charged, almost aggressive and abrasive. They are being asked about the numbers planned for the day, and those not keeping up with the daily run rate are being reprimanded.

The next level would be on arriving at a solution and how one can use analytics to overcome the problem.\r\n\r\nFirst, banks need an analytics-ready mind-set. Analytics transforms everyday work in surprising ways, so leaders must open their minds to the possibilities :                    1) Great analytics starts with high-value questions, not data. To guide the discovery process, ask what problem you want to solve and how much value the solution can create. Do not launch yourself into analysis for the sake of analysis or into intellectually interesting problems whose solutions are not actionable.                         2) The smallest edge can make the biggest difference. Advanced analytics is not about solving your biggest problems; it’s about solving hundreds of small ones that all add up. Especially in operations, these techniques can help to redefine processes and shorten them by several steps.                                                                           3) Insights live at the boundaries between data sets. Remember the bank that combined six or seven discrete data sets to build a tool predicting the next product to buy? It realized that lots of relationships become apparent only when it compared widely varying parameters. Banks have massive amounts of data scattered through different departments. Pilots to bring together small samples of information can reveal the potential.                                                                                                  4) Loops beat lines every time. Following a process can be a slog, and to do so you sometimes have to put on blinders. But that mentality is exactly wrong for advanced analytics. Banks that use feedback loops can not only be faster to market than competitors but also arrive there with better products. Ultimately, machines learn just as we do: by trial and error. 5)Design matters. You want people to use your new tools. A beautiful algorithm deserves an attractive package that catches the eye of your users. Most of them can’t read code or understand the output of a model. To act on these insights, they need easily readied and used dashboards that help them make decisions and test potential scenarios.','More than 90 percent of the top 50 banks around the world are using advanced analytics. Most are having one-off successes but can’t scale up. Nonetheless, some leaders are emerging. Such banks invest in talent through graduate programs. They partner with firms that specialize in analytics and have committed themselves to making strategic investments to bolster their analytics capabilities. Within a couple of years, these leaders may be able develop a critical advantage. Where they go, others must follow—and the sooner the better because success will come, more than anything else, from real-world experience','1) By 2020, about 1.7 megabytes a second of new information will be created for every human being on the planet. 2) Second, banks in many regions are under enormous economic pressure.

That’s the core finding of a new BCG study, prepared in partnership with Morgan Stanley Research. The study—based on interviews with data analytics executives and experts, a complementary survey, and joint analyses by BCG and Morgan Stanley—revealed that the financial services sector trails most industries when it comes to successfully generating value and actionable insights from data analytics.                                                                                              FIs continue to collect vast amounts of data, but few are generating a return commensurate with their investment. The potential value of better data analytics—as a result of higher revenues, cost savings, improved customer service, and better decision making—could reach as high as $30 billion. Players that embrace leading practices will be able to grab a significant slice of that pie, while those that lack the required capabilities will have little choice but to fight for the remains and be threatened by disruption.','Our study revealed five actions that FIs can take to address these issues and release the untapped value in data analytics.                                                                                             1) Engineer interactions that generate a fair-value data exchange with customers. FIs have extensive internal data. But they are often missing the kind of unique data that sets an FI apart from its competition by unlocking specific, actionable insights. These unique data elements can be about specific individual preferences or real-time data (such as location). To acquire them, FIs need to engineer digital customer interactions that have a clear value proposition for customers.  2) Create an ecosystem of partners to generate value at scale. By partnering with merchants and other companies across the financial services sector, institutions can tap into a much deeper base of customer and product information. Such mining not only fills a key void for most financial players but also allows them to collaborate with partners to build a richer variety of data-driven offerings that they can then offer to customers. Card-linked offer programs are one example, but much more can be done, especially in fraud detection and prevention. 3) Establish a center of excellence to improve coordination and leadership. To cut through the internal complexity common at most FIs, some top performers have begun to apply a center of excellence model. One leading bank took this approach to bring greater cohesion to its data and analytics initiatives. To ensure buy-in and agreement, the center worked with dedicated liaisons for each of its major business and operational lines. The bank also made sure that the center had wide visibility at the enterprise level, the committed backing of senior leadership, and the opportunity to roll out customer data initiatives in a streamlined manner across the business. Multifaceted teams of data engineers, data scientists, and business intelligence analysts were key to the bank’s success. The center of excellence model pooled these skill sets and internalized the fast-paced culture of innovation that was needed. 4) Take informed risks and refine continuously. Calculated risk taking and rapid product development are hallmarks of digital leaders such as Amazon and Google. FIs can take a page from the same playbook to accelerate innovation around data analytics. A tighter and more effective customer feedback loop is critical. Knowing what customers want and ensuring that new data-enabled offerings successfully hit the mark require rigorous and ongoing test-and-learn cycles. To succeed, FIs must adopt the practices of leading digital players, giving employees the permission and tools to refine customer interactions on the basis of continuous, data-driven feedback loops. 5) Make trust an asset. Our study found that two-thirds of the total value of data analytics depends on earning customer trust. Organizations that proactively manage customer privacy will therefore be best positioned. FIs that share their data policies with customers, restrict the use of customer data to agreed-upon applications, and provide clear and tangible value will create better products and faster growth.','Effective application of data analytics could deliver an earnings-per-share improvement of 5% from cost savings alone, with long-term revenue generation opportunities bringing the prospect of even higher returns.

In our view, emerging analytics technologies can provide new insights that drive differentiation, growth and profitability. However, the magnitude of the potential benefits that should emerge from these technologies remains difficult to forecast reliably. This uncertainty is largely attributed to fundamental gaps between the ways in which information is gathered, insights are generated, action is enabled, and learning is leveraged. Although this challenge is not unique to the financial services industry, a successful strategy for addressing it is particularly important given the industry’s information intensity, as well as the negative impact of recent market structure changes on revenue and margins','The actionable analytics paradigm is specifically aimed at optimizing return on investments in both staff and technology by addressing recurring gaps in understanding and ability to execute. 1) Context Awareness: The understanding of what constitutes a relevant environment is continually expanded through ongoing discovery of correlations between traditional and non-traditional data sources. Business value-  Differentiation, Competitive advantage, Improved retention, Increased loyalty. 2) Closed loop: Consequences (direct and circumstantial) of information-sharing and actions are consistently monitored and analyzed to facilitate continuous learning and improvement. Business value -Increased accountability,Improved fact base for operational enhancement and investments. 3) Immediate: Tools are provided to craft real-time responses to both anticipated and unanticipated requests/inputs. Business value- Accelerated task execution, Operational simplification. 4) Balanced: The balance between the organization’s ability to filter incoming information and amplify responses is maintained at all levels within the organization. Business Value-  Increased efficiency (via reduction of non-essential task). 5) Trustworthy:Relevance, credibility and reliability is measured and analyzed on an ongoing basis along the entire value chain. Business value- Accelerated adoption,Reduction in oversight costs.','In our point of view, financial institutions’ current analytics initiatives remain relatively siloed and narrowly scoped. Some of these initiatives, such as high-speed trading and fraud analytics, have yielded substantial, measurable business benefits. However, many customer-facing and operational analytics initiatives have failed to realize their full potential due to the fact that the sponsoring organizations do not fully enable and track the execution of the actions to capture the opportunities identified through application of advanced analytics techniques and tools. Although market challenges are forcing financial institutions to experiment with analytics without necessarily having clear business cases, results to date have been mixed because these organizations lack a cohesive framework. Use of our proposed actionable analytics framework during the specification and design of an analytics initiative can significantly increase the potential return on investment, while significantly reducing execution risk. A rapid assessment approach is proposed for determining proof of concept projects that are likely to yield measurable value with the lowest upfront investment.','The importance of this linkage, and the industry’s failure to fully achieve it, was underscored in a recent Wall Street Journal 3 article indicating that non-interest expenses at the six biggest banks rose 9.6% from 2009 to 2013, while revenues declined 9.7% during the same period. More specifically, in addition to increases in technology expenditures, compensation costs for client-facing and compliance staffs also rose. For the same six banks, overall salary and benefits have risen from 29% of revenues in 2007 to 35% of revenues in 2013 despite the fact that these institutions have cut 88,110 positions (7.5% of staff) since 2011','2020-08-05 10:32:04',5),(44,5,1,'Why AI Is Transforming The Banking Industry','Why AI Is Transforming The Banking Industry','BFSI','Forbes','https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/04/05/why-ai-is-transforming-the-banking-industry/#11083f817dd6','For many years banks have been at the forefront of using technology to help with both front-of-house and back-of-house operations.

This was a big goal for the bank because it was one of the primary security concerns when it comes to doing a majority of your banking through a digital medium, and this is especially true with the variety of offerings and services that USAA offers. Right now they are using AI to look at and analyze how their customers are using their apps, where it\'s being used, and typical behaviors that the customers display when interacting with the apps to be able to analyze patterns and detect any potential anomalies and possible fraud taking place. Investing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies : Currently many large banks such as Bank of America, Capital One, and others have AI enabled chatbots to help their customers with a variety of tasks. Chatbots are able to engage and interact with customers 24/7 breaking down the idea of traditional banking hours. When serving members all over the world, this is very important. Customers are becoming increasingly comfortable conversing with chatbots for a variety of things making this a logical next step for the bank to invest in.

Its potential is brought out most efficiently when integrated with business processes to draw analytic insights, generating projections that can be used automatically by other systems like a BPM or CRM system. Adaptive analytics: It allows real-time optimization as customer-specific strategies are automatically adapted to better address customer responses during live customer interactions. Data visualization: Many organizations hold vast amounts of data, but struggle to discover its business value. Emerging business intelligence and data visualization capabilities will help companies provide actionable intelligence and find discernible patterns within large datasets. Firms can now integrate advanced interactive visualization capabilities within their CRM and digital process automation (DPA) solutions, to uncover hidden patterns, and make smarter business decisions.','The usage of data analytics in India has vastly improved over the past few years and obtaining customer intelligence has become simpler','According to NASSCOM, the big data analytics industry in India is expected to reach $16 billion by 2025.

As banks face increasing pressure to stay profitable, understanding customer needs and preferences becomes a critical success factor. New models of proactive risk management are being increasingly adopted by major banks and financial institutions, especially in the wake of Basel II accord. Through Data mining and advanced analytics techniques, banks are better equipped to manage market uncertainty, minimize fraud, and control exposure risk.','While analytics aren’t exactly new to the world of banking, plenty of banks are gearing up for their next big analytics push, propelled by a load of data and new, sophisticated tools and technologies. Why has business analytics jumped to the top of the priority list for banks? Pick a reason. Regulatory reform, managing risk, changing business models, expansion into new markets, a renewed focus on customer profitability – any one of these is reason enough for many banks to reconsider what today’s analytics capabilities can offer. A host of significant, recent changes in the banking industry have resulted in a long list of business challenges that the practice of business analytics may be positioned to address. A number of financial institutions have been quick to recognize and adopt this emerging technology – and it is changing the banking landscape and giving banks and financial institutions previously untapped savings, margins and profit. For example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is using Hadoop technology to manage petabytes of data for advanced analytics and new regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nAs per Deloitte research, three business drivers increase the importance of analytics within the banking industry: Regulatory reform – Major legislation such as Dodd-Frank, the CARD Act, FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and Basel III have changed the business environment for banks. Given the focus on systemic risk, regulators are pushing banks to demonstrate better understanding of data they possess, turn data into information that supports business decisions and manage risk more effectively. Each request has major ramifications on data collection, governance and reporting. Over the next several years, regulators will finalize details in the recently passed legislation. However, banks should start transforming their business models today to comply with a radically different regulatory environment.\r\nCustomer profitability – Personalized offerings are expected to play a big role in attracting and retaining the most profitable customers, but studies show that a small percentage of banks have strong capabilities in this area. The CARD Act and Durbin Amendment make it even more important to understand the behavioral economics of each customer and find ways to gain wallet share in the most profitable segments.\r\nOperational efficiency – while banks have trimmed a lot of fat over the past few years, there is still plenty of room for improvement, including reducing duplicative systems, manual reconciliation tasks and information technology costs.','In order to discover the set of critical success factors that will help banks reach their strategic goals, they need to move beyond standard business reporting and sales forecasting. By applying data mining and predictive analytics to extract actionable intelligent insights and quantifiable predictions, banks can gain insights that encompass all types of customer behavior, including channel transactions, account opening and closing, default, fraud and customer departure.','1) According to IBM’s 2010 Global Chief Executive Officer Study, 89 percent of banking and financial markets CEOs say their top priority is to better understand, predict and give customers what they want. Financial metrics and KPIs provide effective measures for summarizing your overall bank performance.\r\n2) The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ 2010 Global Fraud Study found that the banking and financial services industry had the most cases across all industries – accounting for more than 16% of fraud.\r\n3) Across the industries studied, banking is predicting the greatest increase in risk analytics investments, with 73 percent of banking respondents foreseeing more than a 10 percent rise in expenditure. Forty-two percent of banks calculate risk indicators by collecting data from the execution environment that feeds monitoring dashboards.\r\nBetter modeling is a critical component of credit risk analytics, with European banks more likely to use only internal models (18 percent versus 13 percent globally), while Chinese banks are more likely to use only external models (14 percent versus 7 percent globally).\r\nMost banks have a dedicated risk analytics group with between one and 20 people deployed. Eighty-five percent of banks have a risk analytics group for credit risk validation. Significant majorities of banks across all regions have quality controls in place over the collection of historical data. ASEAN institutions are most likely to do so at 85 percent, and Europe is least likely, at 64 percent. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of banks across all regions use stress-testing regularly to verify capital adequacy.\r\n4) American Banker Research recently set out to discover the demand and usage for customer analytics throughout the banking industry. To their surprise, most (71%) of the 170 bankers in the weighted survey do not use customer analytics, but within a year that might not be true. Among those non-users, the plans to buy analytics are not impressive. Only 2% plan to buy customer analytics in the next six months, 4% in the six to 12 months and 14% in more than a year from now.\r\n5) Cost was the biggest barrier, noted by 36%. Another issue is more pressing IT issues taking precedence – about 32% of bankers surveyed said a focus on other initiatives was the primary obstacle to using customer analytics at their institution. The third primary reason for not using customer analytics, given by 23% of these bankers, was skepticism about the ability of the software to provide business value or a return on investment. On the other hand, 33% of bankers who do use customer analytics say they plan to increase spending on such programs by a mean of 15% in 2013. About 35% of these users are interested in adding social media content to the data they analyze. And these bankers reported several benefits to using the software. More than a third (37%) said the software improves the impact of marketing efforts. About 28% of respondents said that an increase in wallet share was the top benefit their institution reaped from customer analytics. A smaller group, 18%, identified improved underwriting and/or a reduction in loan loss rates as the primary benefit.\r\n','2020-08-05 11:48:57',5);

It empowers us as consumers to get exactly what we want from a brand, when we want it. The benefits within healthcare are equally compelling and have the potential to radically improve the care we receive from the NHS. Data is fast becoming our lifeblood.\r\n','Most of us are in agreement that stretching NHS staff further isn’t the answer and could in fact be detrimental to patient wellbeing. But underfunding has reached crucial levels, so it is vital that efficiencies with technology make key differences in the long term. Many trusts and practices are embracing next generation communication and collaboration technologies such as video calling for remote care or smart IoT devices instead of elderly assisted living. While these technologies are making an obvious difference to patient care, the data they generate combined with historic hospital information will be the ultimate game changer in improving healthcare efficiency and patient care.\r\n\r\nAnalysing this untapped resource can help identify and address hospital bottlenecks at crucial stages. Data analytics will enable hospitals to visualise and compare data from various touch points across departments, eliminating silos and allowing for better triage of incoming patients and assignment of available beds. By understanding bed occupancy from a mobile dashboard in real time, surgeons can be more efficient at scheduling theatre operations and reduce waiting times.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull patient records accessible anywhere during emergencies\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, a single platform containing patient records gathered from various sources, including wearable and other IoT devices, will enable clinicians to quickly access a patient’s full medical history. This could include DNA code, fingerprints, facial and eye recognition, donor information, current prescriptions, family medical history, current ailments, and allergies. Imagine triage where doctors could immediately understand which patient requires most urgent treatment. In an ageing population with ever increasing bed usage, this would greatly increase efficiency. An unconscious patient carrying data history on a wearable device could be triaged appropriately and given the right treatment based on their DNA and medical history. Their family could be quickly informed via instant message and given access rights to the patient’s ward.\r\n\r\nPopulation health management\r\n\r\n\r\nBy layering patient records with demographic and employment data, the sector can apply predictive analytics technology to foresee and mitigate population health crises such as diabetes. This improved level of patient understanding will enable hospitals to better target health education initiatives so patients can make lifestyle changes. Hospitals can also evaluate the performance of vaccination programmes to reduce health risks before they develop into conditions that require treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter data protection and staff resource allocation\r\n\r\n\r\nMultifactor security systems using biometrics and data analytics instead of passwords and swipe cards will enable staff to easily and securely gain access to patient files, wards and theatres and reduce the risk of data theft.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn analytics based ID system will also allow doctors to locate staff around the hospital in real time, helping them to better respond to a major incident such as a terror attack. Doctors can use smart devices to reallocate the most appropriate staff immediately to patients based on their injuries and medical history. Clinicians will also be able to visualise data to identify patterns in wards where certain areas might be tended to less often, and recognise any links between attention levels and patient recovery and mortality. Changes to the ward layout and staffing schedules could make a significant difference to a patient’s wellbeing.\r\n','The UK is one the world’s most forward thinking digital economies and the healthcare system must not be excluded.

The clearest and most immediate business impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been a major disruption to supply chains. Having originated in China, the region was hit hard as a large number of citizens contracted the disease and many were forced into quarantine. This led to partial and full shutdowns of plants and factories, some of which were being used by prominent technology companies to manufacture their goods and products. For example, Apple experienced shortages on its iPhone supply as a result of the company\'s primary manufacturer, Foxconn, shutting down much of its production in China. Ultimately for Apple, this will lead to a significantly reduced forecast in iPhone shipments through Q1—by as much as 10%, according to estimates by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cited by MacRumors. And while companies often have contingency plans, which revolve around ramping up production in a region that isn\'t impacted, the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the globe makes it very difficult to pinpoint which regions would be least affected. Even then, the momentum and resources of the Chinese economy will not be easily replicated—\'Made in China\' initiatives have seen the government invest billions in advanced manufacturing sectors, including telecommunications equipment and semiconductors.\n2. The spread of the coronavirus has caused several of the most important tech conferences to be canceled, likely resulting in numerous missed partnership opportunities. Most notably, Mobile World Congress (MWC), which was set to take place February 24-27 in Barcelona, was canceled due to concerns over the virus. MWC is a cornerstone event in the connectivity industry, as it brings together the most important companies in the space to network, share innovations and forge new business partnerships. Several companies rescheduled the events they had planned for MWC, but the continued presence of the coronavirus led others to cancel them entirely. Beyond MWC, Facebook canceled its F8 developer conference and Global Marketing Summit; Google shifted its Google Cloud Next event to online only; and IBM likewise had to livestream its developer\'s conference, which last year hosted over 30,000 attendees. Altogether, the cancellation of major tech events has incurred over $1 billion in direct economic losses, according to estimates from PredictHQ cited by Recode.\nOnline alternatives have helped limit the fallout from canceled conferences, but tech industries will likely still suffer a period of stifled innovation due to forgone in-person business opportunities. Conference attendees do not have the same opportunities to network via live streaming as they do attending in-person events. It would be harder for marketers to casually share best practices over the live streamed Facebook Global Marketing Summit, for instance, than it would be if the event actually took place. Though it is difficult to quantify the value of these chance encounters or informal network sessions, the effects will undoubtedly be felt throughout the impacted industries.\n3. The growing need for remote interactions amid the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted a need for 5G technology, potentially accelerating adoption in the long term. 5G\'s lightning-fast speeds, near-instantaneous communications and increased connection density make it primed for remote interactions, which has become top of mind for many organizations and enterprises as caution mounts over the spread of the virus.

Currently, shareholdings of Government have been rising with bank recapitalization attempts, and these should be brought down to 52% at the earliest as intended by the Government. A roadmap could be announced for bringing Government stake to 33% in three to four years, suggested CII.\r\n\r\nThe industry sector too needs to strengthen internal systems of enterprises and adhere in letter and spirit to regulatory norms, added CII. Strict business processes, accountability, anti-bribery and anti-corruption mechanisms and risk management are some of the areas for companies to strengthen.\r\n\r\nThis is all the more important as India is moving towards ‘ease of doing business’ involving self-regulation and self-certifications.

Financial data can be combined with existing NGO and open-source data to identify specific signs of trafficking and the risk level of particular transactions and accounts. With these results, banks can now validate and improve their machine-learning models and educate staff to better identify trafficking-related transactions. They can also train front line staff to identify trafficking brokers, which can ultimately freeze financial flows of all the intermediaries involved in the trafficking supply chain.\r\n\r\n','Better corporate governance is an ongoing endeavor of CII which is working continuously with enterprises on internalizing organization-wide management ethics and values.\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly malign forces at play in the world of Big Data.

The regulator must institute supervision systems aligned with the changing dimensions of banking and technology to deter misconduct by individual players,” said Ms Kamineni.\r\n\r\nCII stressed that bringing down Government stakes in public sector banks is unavoidable for building expert management practices and greater accountability. Currently, shareholdings of Government have been rising with bank recapitalization attempts, and these should be brought down to 52% at the earliest as intended by the Government. A roadmap could be announced for bringing Government stake to 33% in three to four years, suggested CII.\r\n\r\nThe industry sector too needs to strengthen internal systems of enterprises and adhere in letter and spirit to regulatory norms, added CII. Strict business processes, accountability, anti-bribery and anti-corruption mechanisms and risk management are some of the areas for companies to strengthen.\r\n\r\nThis is all the more important as India is moving towards ‘ease of doing business’ involving self-regulation and self-certifications. The actions of a few fraudulent actors need not translate into more stringent regulatory norms for the entire industry sector when corporate governance structures are strictly followed, emphasized CII.\r\n','Better corporate governance is an ongoing endeavor of CII which is working continuously with enterprises on internalizing organization-wide management ethics and values.\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly malign forces at play in the world of Big Data. All too often our personal data is being manipulated for financial or political gain. It’s no wonder we feel threatened, vulnerable and powerless when it comes to our own data. But what about those who are powerless to begin with? Shockingly, for every 10,000 people in the world, nearly 54 of those individuals are victims of modern slavery, with a quarter being children. Not only do the victims have no rights, but they’re walking among us and living in our communities, and yet we’re largely unaware.

This column assesses the economic forces behind the adoption of Big Tech services in finance. It shows that BigTech lenders thrive in countries with less competitive banks and less strict regulation, and that they have an information advantage from the use of big data and machine learning.\r\n','However, in order to better understand more specific drivers, including the competitive and comparative advantages of Big Tech, it is necessary to understand the lending model in more detail. In particular, we need to understand how lending decisions based on machine learning and the processing of large quantities of information (big data) alter credit assessment. Using data from Mercado Libre, and its lending product Mercado Crédito, we compare the defaults of firms based on their credit score with machine learning and big data from the e-commerce platform (‘internal rating’) and a traditional credit bureau score (Figure 3, left panel). To date, the internal rating has been superior to the credit bureau in predicting defaults (Figure 3, right panel). However, the jury is still out. Any judgement on the ability of Big Tech credit scoring to better pinpoint creditworthiness should be based on a complete cycle, evaluating the probability of default in stress situations.\r\n\r\nBig data refers to the analysis of very large data sets to reveal patterns, trends and associations. The data can come from a range of sources, including satellite imagery, drone videos, simulations, crowdsourcing, social media and global positioning systems.\r\n','The rapid growth of Big Tech in finance will bring both benefits and risks to the future banking system. Big Tech firms may enhance competition and financial inclusion and contribute to the efficiency of financial services. Conversely, such firms may further concentrate market power or give rise to new systemic risks (BIS 2019). Overall, it is important to understand how Big Tech firms fit within the current framework of financial regulation, and under which principles regulation should be organised.

While 2018 was a year of growth for many retailers and brands accelerated by tax cuts and low unemployment, we’re entering a more precarious year. The stock market is in flux, many retailers are facing the reality of steepening tariffs, emerging markets are flexing their muscles as they take on a greater share of global growth, and it’s anyone’s guess on which way the wind might blow fickle consumers and their expectations for connectivity around every transaction. That said, one could also say that the glass is more than half full, and that these challenges also present opportunities for savvy retailers and brands willing to face the winds head','Here are 10 key points of view on what the retail industry should expect in 2019 : 1) Retailers Will Get Personal with Zero-Party Data : Zero-party data is information intentionally shared by the consumer, which is empowering marketers to build direct relationships with consumers, and, in turn, better personalize their marketing efforts, services, offers and product recommendations without the guesswork. 2) Small is the New Big : These niche brands are the future of the retail industry, and the smart traditional retailers are finding ways to participate in this growth.  Walmart’s acquisition of Bonobos is one example of what I believe will be a wave of interesting partnerships and consolidations in this space. 3) Customer-Centricity Will Go Mainstream : In 2018, retailers learned that simply monitoring social media is not enough. We believe that, thanks to the adoption of technologies like Voice of Consumer (VoC) Analytics, 2019 will be the year that the industry actually makes the customer-centric model happen, as it offers a robust solution that enables them to determine what their customers want and also to deliver it – with speed and at scale. 4) Retailers and Consumers Will Begin to Feel the Weight of Tariffs : Retailers will be faced with making decisions in 2019 to determine the categories and products where they raise prices and push the cost increases onto the customers, and where they need to absorb the cost increases themselves. This may force retailers to evaluate whether it makes sense to exit certain categories if they cannot sell product profitably. 5) Algorithms Take Control : In its 2018 study entitled How Analytics and Digital will drive Next Generation Retail Merchandising, McKinsey stated, “Winning decisions are increasingly driven by analytics more than instinct, experience, or merchant ‘art’. By leveraging smarter tools—those beyond backward-looking, “hind sighting” analysis—retailers can increasingly make forward-looking predictions that are quickly becoming the “table stakes” necessary to keep up.” 6) Millennials will flock to Brands – they will be Luxury : Millennials seek and find brands they want, regardless of channel.  Of course, they prefer to shop online, but they also value experiences and will enter a store if it delivers something unique. Claudia D\'Arpizio, a Milan-based partner at Bain &  Co. and one of the study\'s lead authors, stated: “The brands that are well positioned to capture the Millennial market are moving away from the old luxury habits: from celebrating their own heritage to celebrating consumers’ passions; from looking obsessively into their past to providing futuristic aesthetic visions; from \'shouting their name\' to enabling consumers’ self-expression.” Gucci is a great example and is resonating with Millennials\r\n\r\nI am personally fascinated by predictive analytics and the ability to combine data elements to create an approximate idea of what the future may hold. Although data modeling has been used quite extensively in certain industries (e.g., weather predictions based on specific historic models and key indicators, insurance estimates and actuarial tables, etc.), the concept of applying similar science to retail holds unrealized potential. Given technology advancements and data-mining tools, potential future predictions -- in other words, answering the question “What lies ahead?” -- seems far more attainable than ever before. Considering big data already captured within the retail sector, it becomes mind-boggling. Virtually all industries have pools of information that could be used for predictive purposes. This reminds me of a presentation I sat through nearly three decades ago by a then-IBM executive who suggested that the future will be owned by those who have the keys to data and the intelligence that it generates. And, as recently as this month\'s National Retail Federation event, the power of data was repeatedly emphasized.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent blog post from McKinsey, \"winning decisions are increasingly driven by analytics more than instinct, experience, or merchant \'art\'; what succeeded in the past is now a poor predictor of the future, and analytics is helping to inform and unlock new pockets of growth.\"\r\n\r\n','We may see “perception” become “reality” with our economy.  The media continues to hype the market’s volatility and a potential recession while corporate earnings and unemployment figures continue to speak differently.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve is raising rates to allow them to “have something to work with” if a recession were to occur. Retail growth is over 4% and the economy is healthy; however, this sustained “perception” has the potential to create the “reality” of a recession later in 2019.  I don’t want to be among the many that helps to create this inaccurate “perception”, so I am focused on the facts (stated above). As in any year, 2019 will have tremendous opportunity for those who spot the trends and position their companies to capitalize on them.\r\n','1) A recent survey found that 64 percent of consumers are actually fine with retailers saving purchase history and personal preferences if more personalization is offered.  2) A study by Retail Dive found that digitally-native brands plan to open over 850 stores in the next 5 years.  In comparison, traditional brick-and-mortar-based retailers closed approximately 7,000 stores and opened approximately 3,000 stores in 2018, nearly all of which were in the value category (Dollar General, Five Below, Aldi, etc). 3) Recently, Kalypso’s 2018 Digital Innovation Research found that 84 percent of retailers say VoC analytics are important and 59 percent are investing now or will be by the end of 2019. 5) In 2019, we’ll start to see the real impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports - which will increase from 10 percent to a hefty 25 percent. 6) Millennial purchasing power continues to increase.  By 2025, Bain & Co. forecasts that Millennials and Generation Z will represent 45% of the global personal luxury goods market. \r\n\r\nAt 55 percent, just over half of the U.S. is subscribed to Prime, which is about the same as in 2017.  This was the first year that Prime membership did not increase.

Therefore, managing and channelizing data to work towards customer delight as well as generate healthy profits is crucial to survive prosperously. In the case of big retail players internationally as well as in India, data or rather big data analytics is now being applied at every stage of the retail process - tracking emerging popular products, forecasting sales and future demand through predictive simulation, optimising product placements and offers via customer heat-mapping and many more. Alongside this, identifying the customers likely to be interested in particular product types based on their previous purchase behaviours, working out the best way to approach them through targeted marketing efforts and finally working out what to sell them next is what forms the core of data analytics. This article is the outcome of a descriptive research on the past, present and future of retail industry and the application of business analytics in shaping appropriate marketing strategies.','CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR IN RETAIL INDUSTRY It is expected that consumer goods firms will now be focusing on online and social media channels to get into consumer’s mindshare due to the growing mobile internet revolution in India. About 650 million people are expected to be online by 2020, out of which 250 million will be shopping online - spending more than $50 billion. Interestingly, at least $5 billion of this expenditure is expected to be on packaged consumer goods. In the modern, technology-driven world, users or customers in the retail scenario, are not only accustomed to the digital comfort, but they are also very savvy in terms of using it. Thus, when it comes to retail, a customer who now has a fast paced world and is extremely used to instant gratification, is not only impatient and busy but also looking to be the beneficiary of an excellent service. Just like there are many customers out there, there also exist numerous companies, which are rapidly striving to get online and combat the massive competition, from the others like them. In their bid to stay on top of the game, it is important for those companies to be able to fully understand, exactly what makes the customer click, their likes, their dislikes, basically a full 360-degree view of their customer. This understanding gives them a solid ground to excel at satisfying their customers and on the other hand, attracting the right kind of prospective customers as well. Analytics plays the most crucial role in this process as, it is the very thing that drives those ‘understand what makes the customer decide’, policies of the retail companies. Through the various functions that it carries forward, it creates insights such as, how would a company be able to increase margins at the product level, it also provides insights in what the customer is like, or why the customer would want to buy a certain product. This is called Market Basket Analysis. The analytics help the companies also identify those items, which a customer would be very likely of purchasing together, what promotions and offers would work the very best for which products and personalized offers for every individual customer. These insights are totally customer based, but there are also those that are fully company based insights. Analytics is able to give the insights in terms of how much spending would a company have to do, store wise product mix, optimal pricing that would get them more buyers, efficient stock strategies and many more. These, small yet effective insights, gives a retailer acumen about future consumer behavior, which is a must to stay alive in the competitive retail world. This would be a far cry from the historical retailers who only scratched the surface while making use of the piles of customer data available with them. And with the social media redefining the rules of the game, understanding and leveraging these social media sentiments can give them insights into the customer behavior and intentions. The formidable power of social media that can make or break brands is forcing the retailers to transform the retail landscape dramatically with interactive and immediate communication strategies pushing away the traditional approach. Customer has indeed become the king for retailers that needs an ‘out of the way’ experience with unexpected customized and bespoke services on offer to be able to make an impression in the bevy of lures already preoccupying their minds. The examples of EBay, Amazon and so many others, who have successfully reaped great benefits of data analytics, goes on to prove that retailers, large and small would definitely be able to harness the miraculous benefits of analysing not only structured, but also unstructured data on consumer behavior.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGES IN RETAIL ANALYTICS Retailers have already started putting data analytics at the heart of their operations across the value chain - procurement, supply chain, sales and marketing, store operations, and customer management. However, they now need to establish a big data ecosystem, which processes multiple terabytes of new data and petabytes of historical data, which will help them improve their revenues via analytics-based decision-making. While this may sound really exciting, big data management and analysis comes with its own set of challenges. Several issues will have to be kept in mind to optimize the full capabilities of big data. Privacy, security, intellectual property, and even liability policies need to be stringent in terms of big data. Since big data encapsulates high end analytics, specially trained professionals need to be added to the team to utilize and functionalize the big data. Companies need to integrate information from multiple data sources, often from third parties, as well as deploy an efficient data to aid such an environment. Many times companies fall in shortsightedness, failing to implement insights from analytics. However, this could be fixed by continuous alterations of retail styles where a certain team is allotted for task of arrangement of insights and their implementation','Retailing is at the platform for more data-driven disruption because the quality of data available from internet purchases, social-network conversations, and recently, location-specific smart phone interactions have emerged into a new entity for digital based transactions. Improved performance, better risk management, and the ability to unearth insights that would otherwise remain hidden, are the benefits organisations reap through utilization of big data management. Retailers can benefit immensely form a structured analytics-driven approach that will help them understand how their customers are using their products and services, how their operations and supply chain are performing, how to manage their workforce and how to identify key risks - insights that they then can then act upon. The pace and the dexterity with which micro data is collected, gives the retailers immediate insights on the shopping trends. This analysis on the move allows them to adjust their prices and add to the lure by announcing on the spot discounts on the sales floor based on their current and previous shopping patterns. This data, often collected through interactive mobile devices in stores, provides the retailer an understanding of the buyers needs and give insights into making smarter decisions about product placement in the store. Data capture and analytics usage certainly have come a long way in the last ten years, and it is interesting to look back on how trends in data analytics have affected the marketplace. As the Internet of Things expands further and our world becomes even more connected, this space will continue to evolve.','1) Backed by robust economic growth and rising household incomes, consumer spending in India is expected to touch $3.6 trillion (about Rs.240 trillion) by 2020, increasing India’s share in global consumption to 5.8%—more than twice its current levels.

The store was arranged to cater to her needs, but the neighborhood was now comprised of older adults with limited mobility and fixed incomes. How could the data predict their navigation pattern, category preferences and better cater to their overall shopping occasion? The hypothesis I would look to prove is whether shelves should be lower and aisles wider, whether certain categories (e.g., sugary cereals and baby diapers) should be downsized and how to rearrange the checkout to be less confined and more staff-centric. Predictive analytics could be used to model the potential result of such changes and allow the retailer to assess whether such an investment would be justified by the return.','Today a delicate balance exists between staid and proven stock keeping units (SKUs) and potential innovators and disrupters.

We will also outline a number of use cases where inserting the right data and analysis can deliver value to the decisions retailers are making today. This helps them to optimize every part of the customer decision journey to improve conversion, margins, and brand experience.','Analytics are driving the move from merchant-driven business models—where the product is the differentiator—to digital models, where every decision is informed by data. Brand engagements are becoming more closely aligned with individual shopper preferences, creating a brand relationship that is shifting from a “nice to have,” time-sensitive offer-based relationship to a “must have” digital companionship based on deep insights and understanding of the consumer. To achieve this critical differentiation, retailers are depending less on increasingly shorter product cycles and more on the enduring differentiators of relationship and customer experience created through strategic use of data and analytics. Retailers need good data; but more importantly, they need the right data to gain the insights that can transform their businesses. Value comes from analyzing new data types in the context of specific business knowledge, such as transaction log (T-log) and loyalty information, campaign results, and pricing actions. Every shopper engagement, inventory movement, and promotion leaves a data trail providing opportunities for new capabilities, both from historical data and real-time information, to support decisions across the business. \r\n\r\nHow Can Retailers Get Started with Analytics? Defining a far-reaching analytics strategy starts with the basics: having a good vision of the endgame. Each retailer needs to answer the question, “What does it take to win?” in the context of their specific company, market, promotion, category, department, or process. It sounds easy, but it often is not: Part of designing a data strategy is defining the decisions that need to be made and mapping the right data to inform them. Once the data requirements are defined, the analytics sources can be selected. Let’s look at some simple examples to highlight the process. Imagine that what it takes to win for a mall retail store is the basic need to get the shopper to enter the store. Perhaps the conversion rate is actually quite high once they enter, with an average ticket that is up year over year, but the greatest hindrance to “winning” is the low volume of traffic entering the store. The focus for this retailer is to acquire and analyze data on traffic passing by versus actual shoppers entering their store. Managers would want to examine their “mall traffic conversion” (the percent of shoppers passing by who also enter the store) over time as they change window displays, execute incentives, and leverage promotions to shoppers who are nearby, on mobile, using social media, or visiting the store website. They should also be interested in mobile metrics such as unique and repeat visits and associated and unassociated devices, as the store will benefit from monitoring Twitter and photo postings to ensure the right\r\nproducts are being featured. Knowing what works best for getting shoppers to enter the store, measuring it, and achieving\r\nit allows this retailer to use the right data to win in their business\r\n\r\nUse Cases: Retail Analytics in the Real World The applied uses of analytics to real-world decision making are numerous, and many retail industry leaders are achieving value with innovative new approaches. A few recent examples include: • Specialty retailers using video analytics to study customer paths and behavior, helping them to design more effective store layouts • Big Box retailers investing in Wi-Fi networking and new mobile way-finding apps to help customers navigate through large stores or malls, getting them to desired products faster • Resorts and hotels investing in mobile analytics to gather shopper information from their retail spaces • Mall operators using the network to track social media and shopping patterns, and delivering this value-add information to tenants • Grocery and fast-moving goods retailers utilizing video analytics for traffic and conversion analysis, and then using the same information to integrate workforce management and re-align staffing based on traffic trends • Specialty retailers using social sentiment analytics to improve “voice of the customer” feedback to assess overall brand status and the launch of new products, services, or offers','In this paper, we have introduced a vision of analytics as a new guiding principle for operating in today’s tumultuous retail environment. We’ve discussed the power of becoming a datadriven decision-making culture, and shown how access to accurate, scalable, and actionable data can help retailers set a roadmap to success through a better understanding of their customers and of their store operations. We’ve also covered how data can reveal exposures as well as opportunities for the retailer. Knowing who is not purchasing and why can be as important as understanding those who do purchase.

Merchandising analytics enable planners to align their merchandising decisions with customer expectations. The key areas of merchandising analytics are assortment planning, product adjacency and space allocation. Marketing analytics: To keep up with changing customer demands and ensure loyalty, retailers need marketing analytics for deeper customer insight, targeted interactions and improved customer services.  Marketing analytics quickly combine all relevant customer data—from point of sale systems,customer relationship management system, loyalty cards, etc., with social media data—perform sophisticated analytics, and share insights to help optimise marketing decisions. It can help to deepen customer insight,optimise multichannel performance, improve marketing effectiveness and enhance social media presence. Supply chain analytics: Retail profitability is directly impacted by the logistics efficiency to maximise demand fulfilment and avoid any back orders or stock-outs. These include interventions in logistics, inventory and supplier performance. Store operation analytics: The performance of retail operations depends on various factors,including the effectiveness of the store staff, the cost incurred on them, reduction of pilferage from the store, management of inventory at the right levels and improvement of the overall staff performance. The important component of a successful analytics framework is an efficient information excellence backbone which integrates the data from various data sources like customers, point of sales, suppliers, market, and social media, and stores it in a ready-to-use format for various analytical modelling applications. The choice of technology would depend on the existing technology landscape, the budget of the retailer and the functionalities that they would like to have in their analytics solutions. ','Adoption of analytics : Hybrid model (recommended): This approach is a combination of the in-house and outsourcing approaches. An external consultant works with the retailer to set up an analytics centre of excellence and to co-create various analytics models on its premises. This not only helps in gaining access to the latest best practices prevalent in the market but also keeps the retailer in control at all times. Data-led insight has the power to add business value to every part of the value chain and to every area of business decision-making. As we rapidly move towards a connected retail environment, ompanies need to master the full potential of the customer data that is collected at numerous digital touchpoints. Retailers have already started putting data analytics at the heart of their operations across the value hain—procurement, supply chain, sales and marketing, store operations, and customer management. They now need to establish a big data ecosystem which processes multiple terabytes of new data and petabytes of historical data. This will help them improve their revenues through analytics based decision-making. ','This is reflected in PwC’s 19th Annual Global CEO Survey (2016),2 which shows that 68% of the global CEOs see data and analytics technology as generating the greatest returns for stakeholder engagement','2020-08-05 10:32:02',5),(38,5,1,'Banking Analytics-The three-minute guide','Banking Analytics-The three-minute guide','BFSI','Deloitte','https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Deloitte-Analytics/dttl-analytics-us-ba-bankinganalytics3minguide.pdf','Why analytics matters: The world of banking has encountered unprecedented change over the past few years, and there’s no reason to think it’s going to subside any time soon. Every quarter brings new questions. How will changes in banking laws and regulations affect profitability? Which stress scenarios should be considered? Who are currently the “high-value” customers? What customers have the highest potential for revenue growth? Increasingly, data is seen as a valuable asset for banking leaders looking to successfully navigate this volatile environment. How do you make sense of all that data? For many in banking, business - analytics is the answer.                                                                                              ','a) Why banking analytics: The next level- Harnessing the power of data with analytics is not a new concept to the banking industry. In fact, the industry is widely considered to be a pioneer in the field of analytics. Analytics should be a part of every major initiative, in areas ranging from customers and risk to finance, workforce, and supply chain. Just as important, analytics is most powerful when it’s not run as a series of mutually-independent programs. Of course, along the way many banks have primarily developed deep, unconnected pockets of analytics expertise within their organizations. Today, the challenge is to develop analytic strengths that span the organization— not just pockets of expertise aligned behind single business lines. Furthermore, banks need to harness both external and internal data from structured and unstructured sources. That’s why analytics has taken on renewed importance recently. b) What to do now: Prioritize the areas of focus Identify where data and analytics can have the greatest impact and obtain leadership engagement from the start (e.g., Customer, Risk, Finance). Streamline your data Provide an integrated view of high quality data vs. siloed pockets across products and lines of business (e.g., Single View of the Customer, Aggregated Risk Exposure by Product). Integrate with decision management systems Analytics insights aren’t worth having if they don’t lead to smarter decisions. Fortunately, these insights can be plugged directly into decision management systems. Fight for talent Finding the right talent (statistical modeling, little data and ‘Big Data’, functional depth) is one of the biggest challenges. Develop a talent plan that builds on both existing internal talent and external sources. Make connections Your organization probably already has developed pockets of analytics excellence. A smart plan for connecting teams across the organization can bolster existing strengths and foster new ones. ','It’s okay to start small: Rebooting and refocusing your bank’s analytics capabilities can seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Many banks start with a small project and expand from there. 6) Analytics isn’t enough; adoption is essential. Use whatever means necessary—incentives, role modeling, communication, more communication—to get decision makers to use the new tools. Way too often, best-in-class algorithms sit idle in computers because users do not trust what they regard as a black box, fear the impact it could have on their roles, or simply do not want to go through the discomfort of change. Creating analytics is like putting jet fuel in your car. At the end of the day, if the driver does not develop the skills needed to drive faster, the effort is wasted. 7) Analytics is a team sport. The skills banks need to make analytics work cannot be contained within a single person—at least not yet. Your teams must include true experts on data science, engineering, data architecture, and design. Faking it with people who do a little bit of everything won’t work.',NULL,'2020-08-05 10:32:03',5),(39,5,1,'Banking on analytics','Banking on analytics','BFSI','Wipro blogs','https://www.wipro.com/en-IN/banking/banking-on-analytics/','Picture this: It is a typical start of the day at a bank that has a daily heavy foot fall. Shutters open to let in the stream of customers waiting outside the branch. Branch officers are neatly seated at their respective counters such as the ‘Demand Draft,’ or the ‘May I Help You’ desk. A peek inside the back office shows the branch manager conducting his daily sales huddle with his relationship managers, sales officers and field staff. The mood is highly charged, almost aggressive and abrasive. They are being asked about the numbers planned for the day, and those not keeping up with the daily run rate are being reprimanded.                                                        The mood is somber and tense; the meeting ends with a strict warning to the sales team and a reminder to meet the numbers, else face severe consequences.

Functional areas like Risk, Compliance, Fraud, NPA monitoring, and Calculating Value at Risk can benefit greatly from Analytics to ensure optimal performance, and in order to take crucial decisions where timing is very important.

The next level would be on arriving at a solution and how one can use analytics to overcome the problem.\r\n\r\nFirst, banks need an analytics-ready mind-set. Analytics transforms everyday work in surprising ways, so leaders must open their minds to the possibilities :                    1) Great analytics starts with high-value questions, not data. To guide the discovery process, ask what problem you want to solve and how much value the solution can create. Do not launch yourself into analysis for the sake of analysis or into intellectually interesting problems whose solutions are not actionable.                         2) The smallest edge can make the biggest difference. Advanced analytics is not about solving your biggest problems; it’s about solving hundreds of small ones that all add up. Especially in operations, these techniques can help to redefine processes and shorten them by several steps.                                                                           3) Insights live at the boundaries between data sets. Remember the bank that combined six or seven discrete data sets to build a tool predicting the next product to buy? It realized that lots of relationships become apparent only when it compared widely varying parameters. Banks have massive amounts of data scattered through different departments. Pilots to bring together small samples of information can reveal the potential.                                                                                                  4) Loops beat lines every time. Following a process can be a slog, and to do so you sometimes have to put on blinders. But that mentality is exactly wrong for advanced analytics. Banks that use feedback loops can not only be faster to market than competitors but also arrive there with better products. Ultimately, machines learn just as we do: by trial and error. 5)Design matters. You want people to use your new tools. A beautiful algorithm deserves an attractive package that catches the eye of your users. Most of them can’t read code or understand the output of a model. To act on these insights, they need easily readied and used dashboards that help them make decisions and test potential scenarios.','More than 90 percent of the top 50 banks around the world are using advanced analytics. Most are having one-off successes but can’t scale up. Nonetheless, some leaders are emerging. Such banks invest in talent through graduate programs. They partner with firms that specialize in analytics and have committed themselves to making strategic investments to bolster their analytics capabilities. Within a couple of years, these leaders may be able develop a critical advantage. Where they go, others must follow—and the sooner the better because success will come, more than anything else, from real-world experience','1) By 2020, about 1.7 megabytes a second of new information will be created for every human being on the planet. 2) Second, banks in many regions are under enormous economic pressure.

That’s the core finding of a new BCG study, prepared in partnership with Morgan Stanley Research. The study—based on interviews with data analytics executives and experts, a complementary survey, and joint analyses by BCG and Morgan Stanley—revealed that the financial services sector trails most industries when it comes to successfully generating value and actionable insights from data analytics.                                                                                              FIs continue to collect vast amounts of data, but few are generating a return commensurate with their investment. The potential value of better data analytics—as a result of higher revenues, cost savings, improved customer service, and better decision making—could reach as high as $30 billion. Players that embrace leading practices will be able to grab a significant slice of that pie, while those that lack the required capabilities will have little choice but to fight for the remains and be threatened by disruption.','Our study revealed five actions that FIs can take to address these issues and release the untapped value in data analytics.                                                                                             1) Engineer interactions that generate a fair-value data exchange with customers. FIs have extensive internal data. But they are often missing the kind of unique data that sets an FI apart from its competition by unlocking specific, actionable insights. These unique data elements can be about specific individual preferences or real-time data (such as location). To acquire them, FIs need to engineer digital customer interactions that have a clear value proposition for customers.  2) Create an ecosystem of partners to generate value at scale. By partnering with merchants and other companies across the financial services sector, institutions can tap into a much deeper base of customer and product information. Such mining not only fills a key void for most financial players but also allows them to collaborate with partners to build a richer variety of data-driven offerings that they can then offer to customers. Card-linked offer programs are one example, but much more can be done, especially in fraud detection and prevention. 3) Establish a center of excellence to improve coordination and leadership. To cut through the internal complexity common at most FIs, some top performers have begun to apply a center of excellence model. One leading bank took this approach to bring greater cohesion to its data and analytics initiatives. To ensure buy-in and agreement, the center worked with dedicated liaisons for each of its major business and operational lines. The bank also made sure that the center had wide visibility at the enterprise level, the committed backing of senior leadership, and the opportunity to roll out customer data initiatives in a streamlined manner across the business. Multifaceted teams of data engineers, data scientists, and business intelligence analysts were key to the bank’s success. The center of excellence model pooled these skill sets and internalized the fast-paced culture of innovation that was needed. 4) Take informed risks and refine continuously. Calculated risk taking and rapid product development are hallmarks of digital leaders such as Amazon and Google. FIs can take a page from the same playbook to accelerate innovation around data analytics. A tighter and more effective customer feedback loop is critical. Knowing what customers want and ensuring that new data-enabled offerings successfully hit the mark require rigorous and ongoing test-and-learn cycles. To succeed, FIs must adopt the practices of leading digital players, giving employees the permission and tools to refine customer interactions on the basis of continuous, data-driven feedback loops. 5) Make trust an asset. Our study found that two-thirds of the total value of data analytics depends on earning customer trust. Organizations that proactively manage customer privacy will therefore be best positioned. FIs that share their data policies with customers, restrict the use of customer data to agreed-upon applications, and provide clear and tangible value will create better products and faster growth.','Effective application of data analytics could deliver an earnings-per-share improvement of 5% from cost savings alone, with long-term revenue generation opportunities bringing the prospect of even higher returns.

In our view, emerging analytics technologies can provide new insights that drive differentiation, growth and profitability. However, the magnitude of the potential benefits that should emerge from these technologies remains difficult to forecast reliably. This uncertainty is largely attributed to fundamental gaps between the ways in which information is gathered, insights are generated, action is enabled, and learning is leveraged. Although this challenge is not unique to the financial services industry, a successful strategy for addressing it is particularly important given the industry’s information intensity, as well as the negative impact of recent market structure changes on revenue and margins','The actionable analytics paradigm is specifically aimed at optimizing return on investments in both staff and technology by addressing recurring gaps in understanding and ability to execute. 1) Context Awareness: The understanding of what constitutes a relevant environment is continually expanded through ongoing discovery of correlations between traditional and non-traditional data sources. Business value-  Differentiation, Competitive advantage, Improved retention, Increased loyalty. 2) Closed loop: Consequences (direct and circumstantial) of information-sharing and actions are consistently monitored and analyzed to facilitate continuous learning and improvement. Business value -Increased accountability,Improved fact base for operational enhancement and investments. 3) Immediate: Tools are provided to craft real-time responses to both anticipated and unanticipated requests/inputs. Business value- Accelerated task execution, Operational simplification. 4) Balanced: The balance between the organization’s ability to filter incoming information and amplify responses is maintained at all levels within the organization. Business Value-  Increased efficiency (via reduction of non-essential task). 5) Trustworthy:Relevance, credibility and reliability is measured and analyzed on an ongoing basis along the entire value chain. Business value- Accelerated adoption,Reduction in oversight costs.','In our point of view, financial institutions’ current analytics initiatives remain relatively siloed and narrowly scoped. Some of these initiatives, such as high-speed trading and fraud analytics, have yielded substantial, measurable business benefits. However, many customer-facing and operational analytics initiatives have failed to realize their full potential due to the fact that the sponsoring organizations do not fully enable and track the execution of the actions to capture the opportunities identified through application of advanced analytics techniques and tools. Although market challenges are forcing financial institutions to experiment with analytics without necessarily having clear business cases, results to date have been mixed because these organizations lack a cohesive framework. Use of our proposed actionable analytics framework during the specification and design of an analytics initiative can significantly increase the potential return on investment, while significantly reducing execution risk. A rapid assessment approach is proposed for determining proof of concept projects that are likely to yield measurable value with the lowest upfront investment.','The importance of this linkage, and the industry’s failure to fully achieve it, was underscored in a recent Wall Street Journal 3 article indicating that non-interest expenses at the six biggest banks rose 9.6% from 2009 to 2013, while revenues declined 9.7% during the same period.

Being a data-rich and data-dependent sector, data analytics is of the utmost importance to banks and financial institutions (FIs) and is a significant part of their digital transformation journey. Legacy banks and FIs are investing in analytics to compete and stay relevant in the market. They are cashing in on the business capabilities of analytics for increased profitability and to identify potential customers,\" says Faisal Husain, Co-founder and CEO, Synechron.\r\nSuman Reddy, MD at Pegasystems India lists a few data analytics trends companies are looking at today. Predictive analytics: Predictive analytics uses current and historical data to predict unknowns like future customer behaviour and activity. For instance, it offers insights into the possibility of customer propensity towards a personalised credit card offer. Its potential is brought out most efficiently when integrated with business processes to draw analytic insights, generating projections that can be used automatically by other systems like a BPM or CRM system. Adaptive analytics: It allows real-time optimization as customer-specific strategies are automatically adapted to better address customer responses during live customer interactions. Data visualization: Many organizations hold vast amounts of data, but struggle to discover its business value. Emerging business intelligence and data visualization capabilities will help companies provide actionable intelligence and find discernible patterns within large datasets. Firms can now integrate advanced interactive visualization capabilities within their CRM and digital process automation (DPA) solutions, to uncover hidden patterns, and make smarter business decisions.','The usage of data analytics in India has vastly improved over the past few years and obtaining customer intelligence has become simpler','According to NASSCOM, the big data analytics industry in India is expected to reach $16 billion by 2025. By deploying analytics, the BFSI sector aims to solve three major business challenges – performance, risk accessibility and profitability.','2020-08-05 10:32:05',5),(46,5,1,'Analytics in Banking Services','Analytics in Banking Services','BFSI','IBM','https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/analytics-banking-services','The banking industry is data-intensive with typically massive graveyards of unused and unappreciated ATM and credit processing data. As banks face increasing pressure to stay profitable, understanding customer needs and preferences becomes a critical success factor. New models of proactive risk management are being increasingly adopted by major banks and financial institutions, especially in the wake of Basel II accord. Through Data mining and advanced analytics techniques, banks are better equipped to manage market uncertainty, minimize fraud, and control exposure risk.','While analytics aren’t exactly new to the world of banking, plenty of banks are gearing up for their next big analytics push, propelled by a load of data and new, sophisticated tools and technologies. Why has business analytics jumped to the top of the priority list for banks? Pick a reason. Regulatory reform, managing risk, changing business models, expansion into new markets, a renewed focus on customer profitability – any one of these is reason enough for many banks to reconsider what today’s analytics capabilities can offer. A host of significant, recent changes in the banking industry have resulted in a long list of business challenges that the practice of business analytics may be positioned to address. A number of financial institutions have been quick to recognize and adopt this emerging technology – and it is changing the banking landscape and giving banks and financial institutions previously untapped savings, margins and profit. For example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is using Hadoop technology to manage petabytes of data for advanced analytics and new regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nAs per Deloitte research, three business drivers increase the importance of analytics within the banking industry: Regulatory reform – Major legislation such as Dodd-Frank, the CARD Act, FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and Basel III have changed the business environment for banks. Given the focus on systemic risk, regulators are pushing banks to demonstrate better understanding of data they possess, turn data into information that supports business decisions and manage risk more effectively. Each request has major ramifications on data collection, governance and reporting. Over the next several years, regulators will finalize details in the recently passed legislation. However, banks should start transforming their business models today to comply with a radically different regulatory environment.\r\nCustomer profitability – Personalized offerings are expected to play a big role in attracting and retaining the most profitable customers, but studies show that a small percentage of banks have strong capabilities in this area. The CARD Act and Durbin Amendment make it even more important to understand the behavioral economics of each customer and find ways to gain wallet share in the most profitable segments.\r\nOperational efficiency – while banks have trimmed a lot of fat over the past few years, there is still plenty of room for improvement, including reducing duplicative systems, manual reconciliation tasks and information technology costs.','In order to discover the set of critical success factors that will help banks reach their strategic goals, they need to move beyond standard business reporting and sales forecasting. By applying data mining and predictive analytics to extract actionable intelligent insights and quantifiable predictions, banks can gain insights that encompass all types of customer behavior, including channel transactions, account opening and closing, default, fraud and customer departure.','1) According to IBM’s 2010 Global Chief Executive Officer Study, 89 percent of banking and financial markets CEOs say their top priority is to better understand, predict and give customers what they want. Financial metrics and KPIs provide effective measures for summarizing your overall bank performance.\r\n2) The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ 2010 Global Fraud Study found that the banking and financial services industry had the most cases across all industries – accounting for more than 16% of fraud.\r\n3) Across the industries studied, banking is predicting the greatest increase in risk analytics investments, with 73 percent of banking respondents foreseeing more than a 10 percent rise in expenditure. Forty-two percent of banks calculate risk indicators by collecting data from the execution environment that feeds monitoring dashboards.\r\nBetter modeling is a critical component of credit risk analytics, with European banks more likely to use only internal models (18 percent versus 13 percent globally), while Chinese banks are more likely to use only external models (14 percent versus 7 percent globally).\r\nMost banks have a dedicated risk analytics group with between one and 20 people deployed. Eighty-five percent of banks have a risk analytics group for credit risk validation. Significant majorities of banks across all regions have quality controls in place over the collection of historical data. ASEAN institutions are most likely to do so at 85 percent, and Europe is least likely, at 64 percent. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of banks across all regions use stress-testing regularly to verify capital adequacy.\r\n4) American Banker Research recently set out to discover the demand and usage for customer analytics throughout the banking industry. To their surprise, most (71%) of the 170 bankers in the weighted survey do not use customer analytics, but within a year that might not be true. Among those non-users, the plans to buy analytics are not impressive. Only 2% plan to buy customer analytics in the next six months, 4% in the six to 12 months and 14% in more than a year from now.\r\n5) Cost was the biggest barrier, noted by 36%. Another issue is more pressing IT issues taking precedence – about 32% of bankers surveyed said a focus on other initiatives was the primary obstacle to using customer analytics at their institution. The third primary reason for not using customer analytics, given by 23% of these bankers, was skepticism about the ability of the software to provide business value or a return on investment. On the other hand, 33% of bankers who do use customer analytics say they plan to increase spending on such programs by a mean of 15% in 2013. About 35% of these users are interested in adding social media content to the data they analyze. And these bankers reported several benefits to using the software. More than a third (37%) said the software improves the impact of marketing efforts. About 28% of respondents said that an increase in wallet share was the top benefit their institution reaped from customer analytics. A smaller group, 18%, identified improved underwriting and/or a reduction in loan loss rates as the primary benefit.\r\n','2020-08-05 11:48:57',5);
